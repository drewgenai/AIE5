### Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE5 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Beyond-ChatGPT)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application. 

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE5/00_Setting Up Git/README.md)!

#### How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ‚ùìQuestions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
- üèóÔ∏è Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- üöß Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

##### üèóÔ∏è Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Aspect Tested: Ability to simplify and explain complex concepts clearly for a non-technical audience.
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶
    - "The Ryzen 9 9950X also delivers generational gains in productivity applications and takes the overall lead in multi-threaded workloads. But those gains can be slim over the company's prior-gen Ryzen 9 7950X, which currently retails for $125 less. The Ryzen 9 9950X was 12% faster than the 7950X in our overall measure of multi-threaded performance and 9% faster in single-threaded work. However, the generational uplift varies by workload, with some heavily-threaded applications showing less of an improvement over the 7950X. In the end, we're looking at a 23% premium for the 9950X over the 7950X for low double-digit gains in performance, and we expect that pricing for the 7950X will decrease further in the future."
    - Aspect Tested: Comprehension and ability to distill key information learned.
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: Ability to Creatively craft an engaging and coherent story.
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Logical reasoning and accurate mathematical problem solving.
    Breaking down a complex problem and accurately generating an answer.
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶
    - "Hey Dummy,

It‚Äôs your brother from my new email. Do me a favor and ask your boss to hire me. Beg him if you have to!üôè I‚Äôd be so good at this job. You know I used to sell more than you at Mom and Dad‚Äôs store when we were kids. I‚Äôm made for this, I‚Äôm always on my phone! I can sell these smartphones in my sleep! C‚Äômon, do me a solid.

‚Äì I. F."
    - Aspect Tested: Ability to understand provided information be able to generate new text to match a specific tone

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

##### üöß Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, push the changes to your HF Space and redo the above vibe check.

To improve the vibes/responses. I've updated the model being utilized by the application from gpt-3.5-turbo to the newer gpt-4o-mini

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
- Aspect Tested: Ability to simplify and explain complex concepts clearly for a non-technical audience.

The first model is doing an okay job here. It explains the overall concept, but the examples are not great for visualization and could be broken down further to help the users understand.

With the updated model, the response further breaks down the explanation and splits it into several steps that refine the examples and explanation before moving on and tying into the next concept. This second model feels like a better way to help an uninformed user to understand the concepts from scatch

2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶
    - "The Ryzen 9 9950X also delivers generational gains in productivity applications and takes the overall lead in multi-threaded workloads. But those gains can be slim over the company's prior-gen Ryzen 9 7950X, which currently retails for $125 less. The Ryzen 9 9950X was 12% faster than the 7950X in our overall measure of multi-threaded performance and 9% faster in single-threaded work. However, the generational uplift varies by workload, with some heavily-threaded applications showing less of an improvement over the 7950X. In the end, we're looking at a 23% premium for the 9950X over the 7950X for low double-digit gains in performance, and we expect that pricing for the 7950X will decrease further in the future."

I've given the model a conclusion from a CPU review to summarize.

- Aspect Tested: Comprehension and ability to distill key information learned.

The 3.5 model breaks down the the key points accurately, but it isn't much more concise than the source material itself.

When the same question is asked with the 4o-mini model, it really breaks down and shortens the responses to their core bullet points while still conveying the key information.


3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: Ability to Creatively craft an engaging and coherent story.
    
The 3.5 model is able to write a an engaging story
the 4o-mini model is similar but seems to make better use of adjectives to draw the reader into the story


4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?

    - Aspect Tested: Logical reasoning and accurate mathematical problem solving.
    Breaking down a complex problem and accurately generating an answer.


The 3.5 model is able to get the correct answer,¬†but it walks through multiplication rather than division.¬†However, it¬†doesn't really break down the steps to get to the answer.
The 4.0 model further illustrates the breaking down of the question into bullet points and sub-bullet points. Displaying key information (Each pack of apples contains 4 apples.) to solve the problem and utilizing division to get to the correct answer. 


5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶
    - "Hey Dummy,

It's your brother from my new email. Do me a favor and ask your boss to hire me. Beg him if you have to!üôè I'd be so good at this job. You know I used to sell more than you at Mom and Dad's store when we were kids. I'm made for this, I'm always on my phone! I can sell these smartphones in my sleep! C'mon, do me a solid.

‚Äì I. F."
    - Aspect Tested: Ability to understand provided information be able to generate new text to match a specific tone

The first model is able to understand and generate the response in a new tone. 

The second model is also able to understand and generate a response in the requested tone but generates the response in template form and breaks it up into more easily readable paragraphs for the end reader.



### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë‚ùì Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

    Vibe checking can be subjective; beyond failure, a response may be seen as a success or correct to me, but it may not be an improvement in a different context or to someone else's tastes. 
    For example, I may like breaking down a summary into bullet points and see that as an improvement, while others may not and prefer to read their response in paragraph form.
