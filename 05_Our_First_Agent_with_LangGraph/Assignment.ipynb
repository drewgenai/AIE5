        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation.

However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here's how it generally works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: The system first retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This step is crucial for grounding the generative model in factual and contextually relevant information.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is then used to augment the input to a generative model. This can involve concatenating the retrieved text with the original input or using it to inform the model's understanding of the context.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model, uses the augmented input to produce a response or generate text. The inclusion of retrieved information helps ensure that the output is more accurate and contextually appropriate.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in applications like question answering, where the system needs to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers based on a large body of knowledge. By combining retrieval and generation, RAG models can leverage the strengths of both approaches to produce high-quality outputs.\""

This paradigm presents challenges for\\nsystems that serve real-time responses to queries that each involve a different\\nLoRA. Prior works optimize the design of such systems but still require\\ncontinuous loading and offloading of LoRAs, as it is infeasible to store\\nthousands of LoRAs in GPU memory. To mitigate this issue, we investigate the\\nefficacy of model compression when serving LoRAs. We propose a method for joint\\ncompression of LoRAs into a shared basis paired with LoRA-specific scaling\\nmatrices. We extend our algorithm to learn clusters of LoRAs that are more\\namenable to joint compression, allowing it to scale gracefully to large LoRA\\ncollections. Our experiments with up to 500 LoRAs demonstrate that compressed\\nLoRAs preserve performance while offering major throughput gains in realistic\\nserving scenarios with over a thousand LoRAs, maintaining 80% of the throughput\\nof serving a single LoRA.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-10-28\\nTitle: KD-LoRA: A Hybrid Approach to Efficient Fine-Tuning with LoRA and Knowledge Distillation\\nAuthors: Rambod Azimi, Rishav Rishav, Marek Teichmann, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou\\nSummary: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across\\nvarious downstream tasks. However, the high computational and memory\\nrequirements of LLMs are a major bottleneck. To address this,\\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank adaptation\\n(LoRA) have been proposed to reduce computational costs while ensuring minimal\\nloss in performance. Additionally, knowledge distillation (KD) has been a\\npopular choice for obtaining compact student models from teacher models. In\\nthis work, we present KD-LoRA, a novel fine-tuning method that combines LoRA\\nwith KD. Our results demonstrate that KD-LoRA achieves performance comparable\\nto full fine-tuning (FFT) and LoRA while significantly reducing resource\\nrequirements. Specifically, KD-LoRA retains 98% of LoRA's performance on the\\nGLUE benchmark, while being 40% more compact. Additionally, KD-LoRA reduces GPU\\nmemory usage by 30% compared to LoRA, while decreasing inference time by 30%\\ncompared to both FFT and LoRA. We evaluate KD-LoRA across three encoder-only\\nmodels: BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3.

Last, future work in the field of attention models is\\nconsidered.\\n\\nPublished: 2022-07-04\\nTitle: Attention mechanisms for physiological signal deep learning: which attention should we take?\\nAuthors: Seong-A Park, Hyung-Chul Lee, Chul-Woo Jung, Hyun-Lim Yang\\nSummary: Attention mechanisms are widely used to dramatically improve deep learning\\nmodel performance in various fields. However, their general ability to improve\\nthe performance of physiological signal deep learning model is immature. In\\nthis study, we experimentally analyze four attention mechanisms (e.g.,\\nsqueeze-and-excitation, non-local, convolutional block attention module, and\\nmulti-head self-attention) and three convolutional neural network (CNN)\\narchitectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet, and Inception) for two representative\\nphysiological signal prediction tasks: the classification for predicting\\nhypotension and the regression for predicting cardiac output (CO). We evaluated\\nmultiple combinations for performance and convergence of physiological signal\\ndeep learning model. Accordingly, the CNN models with the spatial attention\\nmechanism showed the best performance in the classification problem, whereas\\nthe channel attention mechanism achieved the lowest error in the regression\\nproblem. Moreover, the performance and convergence of the CNN models with\\nattention mechanisms were better than stand-alone self-attention models in both\\nproblems. Hence, we verified that convolutional operation and attention\\nmechanisms are complementary and provide faster convergence time, despite the\\nstand-alone self-attention models requiring fewer parameters.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-10-17\\nTitle: An Analysis of Attention Mechanisms: The Case of Word Sense Disambiguation in Neural Machine Translation\\nAuthors: Gongbo Tang, Rico Sennrich, Joakim Nivre\\nSummary: Recent work has shown that the encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in neural\\nmachine translation (NMT) are different from the word alignment in statistical\\nmachine translation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing encoder-decoder\\nattention mechanisms, in the case of word sense disambiguation (WSD) in NMT\\nmodels. We hypothesize that attention mechanisms pay more attention to context\\ntokens when translating ambiguous words. We explore the attention distribution\\npatterns when translating ambiguous nouns. Counter-intuitively, we find that\\nattention mechanisms are likely to distribute more attention to the ambiguous\\nnoun itself rather than context tokens, in comparison to other nouns. We\\nconclude that attention mechanism is not the main mechanism used by NMT models\\nto incorporate contextual information for WSD. The experimental results suggest\\nthat NMT models learn to encode contextual information necessary for WSD in the\\nencoder hidden states. For the attention mechanism in Transformer models, we\\nreveal that the first few layers gradually learn to \"align\" source and target\\ntokens and the last few layers learn to extract features from the related but\\nunaligned context tokens.', name='arxiv', id='9e23d984-bb4a-436a-bc0d-c68e09b9ceac', tool_call_id='call_sZsLY2zc8gVrn5Xj2NWKGyKC')]\n",

It focuses on reducing computational and memory requirements while maintaining performance. LoRA achieves this by adapting models with low-rank updates, which are computationally cheaper than full model updates. Recent research has explored compressing LoRA adapters to serve thousands of them with minimal overhead, and combining LoRA with knowledge distillation to further reduce resource usage while retaining performance.\\n\\n### Tim Dettmers\\n\\nTim Dettmers is a research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI and an incoming assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University. His work focuses on efficient deep learning methods, including quantization, sparsity, and low-bit inference. He aims to make AI models more accessible by reducing their resource requirements, allowing them to be run on regular consumer hardware. Dettmers has contributed to research on 8-bit matrix multiplication for transformers and other methods to optimize AI model performance.\\n\\n### Attention Mechanism in Machine Learning\\n\\nAttention mechanisms are crucial in deep learning models, particularly in tasks like neural machine translation and physiological signal prediction.

            "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to guide generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, to produce useful, accurate, and relevant responses. This practice is crucial for optimizing the outputs of AI tools, allowing users to achieve better results with fewer inputs. It involves creating effective prompts that enable AI models to generate responses based on given inputs, especially in text-based tasks such as Natural Language Processing (NLP). The discipline has evolved to include various techniques, such as few-shot learning and chain-of-thought reasoning, to elicit reliable and compelling results from language models.

Initially, prompts were simple, but as LLMs like GPT-3 became more complex, prompt engineering evolved to match this complexity. Key developments include the introduction of attention mechanisms in 2015, which revolutionized prompt engineering by enhancing language models' contextual understanding. The rise of massive language models like GPT-3 in 2020-2021 further transformed prompt engineering, allowing for greater adaptability and domain-specific tailoring. Advanced prompting techniques, such as multimodal prompting, have emerged in recent years, pushing language models beyond conventional tasks and enhancing their versatility.
