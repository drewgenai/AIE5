        "    - No long-term benefit after a server restart.\n",
        "    - Not useful for large-scale applications needing persistent caching.\n",
        "- No Distributed or Shared Caching\n",
        "  - The cache is local to a single instance, meaning:\n",
        "    - If you have multiple servers handling requests, they do not share the cache.\n",
        "    - Each server will repeat the same queries and recompute answers.\n",
        "- Does Not Handle Dynamic Context Well\n",
        "  - If context changes even slightly, a new response is generated instead of using a cached one.\n",
        "  - This makes it less effective for dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) queries.\n",
        "- No Cache Expiration\n",
        "  - Cached responses never expire unless the server restarts.\n",
        "  - If the LLM model is updated, old cached responses may be outdated.\n",
        "- Input Formatting Must Be Exact\n",
        "  - The cache lookup relies on exact matches of input prompts.\n",
        "  - Even minor differences (e.g., extra spaces, different phrasing) will cause a cache miss, leading to a new LLM request.\n",

        "- For repeated queries that don’t change frequently  \n",
        "  Example: A FAQ chatbot where users ask common questions with static answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For development and testing  \n",
        "  Caching allows developers to test prompts quickly without waiting for LLM responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For reducing API costs & latency in small-scale apps  \n",
        "  If API calls are expensive, caching prevents unnecessary LLM requests.\n",

        "# When is This Least Useful?\n",
